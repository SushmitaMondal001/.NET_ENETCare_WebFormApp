            ENET Care is a charitable organization. The charity aims to improve housing and sanitation for remote communities and the long-term homeless.
ENET Care employs staff who visit needy communities and provide evidence-based interventions. The interventions include education, low-cost housing, portable toilets, mosquito nets, tents and first-aid kits.
Funding comes from a range of sources: government contracts, government grants, corporate sponsorship and public donations. Evidence of progress and success is an important factor in renewing funding.
ENET Care is considering building an information system (an ‘Intervention Monitoring System’) to gather data on the success of their efforts. This data will be used to generate reports for sponsors. In addition, ENET Care plans to eventually use the data to improve its internal decision-making by analysing the effectiveness of its interventions.
